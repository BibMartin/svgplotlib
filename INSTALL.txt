===========================
	Dependencies
===========================

Requisite dependencies:-
======================
    *  libfreetype-dev
    *  python v2.5+
    *  pyparsing

Optional, external backends:-
======================
    *  Cairo
    *  PyQt4


========================
	Libraries
========================
The above optional libraries can be used as alternative
backends for displaying and rendering SVG graphics natively.
This is useful for embedding SVG graphics into desktop
applications.

Alternatively, SVG's can be saved in their native XML format
using Python's built-in cElementTree. 



========================
	Building
========================
If building from source, just cd to the source folder and type:

$ python setup.py build

This has been tested on Linux, Mac and Window machines. Let us
know if you have any problems.
If you don't have administrative privileges, add a --prefix to
install it somewhere in your home directory. 

e.g.
$ python setup.py build --prefix=$HOME/mybinaries

If doing it this way, make sure that you add the relevant path
to the PYTHONPATH environment variable, (depending on your shell
and operating system).
Maybe with something like:-

$ export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/mybinaries/lib/python2.7/site-packages"



========================
	Installing
========================
If the build stage went succesfully, you can install it with:-

$ python setup.py install

with administrator privileges if necessary.

Alternatively, if you have python's setuptools installed, you can
do a one-step build and install with the command:-

$ easy_install svgplotlib
